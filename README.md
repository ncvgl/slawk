## Day 1/14

Slack charges $8/user/month. For a 50-person org, that's $5,000/year.

What if any startup could build their own Slack for $100/year total?

So I'm doing an experiment: Building an open-source Slack clone in 14 days using Claude Code.

I'll share daily updates on:
- Progress & roadblocks
- How AI is (or isn't) helping

This could be a total disaster or actually work. Either way, it'll be educational.
