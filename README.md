## Day 2/14 - Cloning Slack with Claude Code

✅ Local Backend complete (Node.js, real-time messaging, file uploads, search). It is easy for the AI to test so it is easy to build.

🟡 Frontend... it's giving "AliExpress" vibes 😅

I used the Claude browser MCP - it controls my Chrome through an extension, literally inspects Slack's CSS, extracts exact values, and applies them. Closed-loop feedback. Should be pixel-perfect, right? Nope.

My current ambition: Crack this to make it indistinguishable from Slack.

## Day 1/14

Slack charges $8/user/month. For a 50-person org, that's $5,000/year.

What if any startup could build their own Slack for $100/year total?

So I'm doing an experiment: Building an open-source Slack clone in 14 days using Claude Code.

I'll share daily updates on:
- Progress & roadblocks
- How AI is (or isn't) helping

This could be a total disaster or actually work. Either way, it'll be educational.
